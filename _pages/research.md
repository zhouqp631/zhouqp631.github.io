Our research is mainly about new computing methods to solve challenging inverse problems, especially nonlinear inverse problems. 
We combine ideas from numerical analysis, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning to develop more accurate and efficient recovering algorithms. 
We are particularly interested in
## Bayesian scientific computing
- physics-guided deep generative models (GAN, VAE, diffusion model) to improve accuracy, efficiency, etc.
  
- goal-oriented uncertainty quantification (UQ) through the combination of both forward UQ and reverse UQ

## Scientific machine learning
- the emerging use of data-driven and machine learning methods to address problem classes that were out of reach for traditional methods
