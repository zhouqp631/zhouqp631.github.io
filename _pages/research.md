We focus on developing new computational methods for uncertainty quantification and scientific computing. Our work aims to design efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy algorithms for complex problems in scientific and engineering fields. To this end we use insights from numerical analysis, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning.

## Uncertainty quantification for inverse problems
- The design of novel sampling methods, e.g., 

- Bayesian(Statistical) inversion, e.g., 

- UQ-guided reconstruction models with physics (working in progress)


## AI4Science
- Artificial intelligence for medical imaging problems, e.g., 

- Artificial intelligence for bioinformatics, e.g.,
