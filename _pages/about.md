Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a Lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University. I studied Mathematics and received a Bachelor's degree in 2012, along with a Master's degree in Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics from Lanzhou University in 2015. In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of [Jinglai Li](https://lijinglai.github.io/) and [Xiaoqun Zhang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/index.html). Subsequently, from 2019 to 2020, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at Meituan. In July 2020, I joined Central South University.
