Welcome to my homepage! <br>
I am an Associate Professor at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University. I earned my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (2012) and M.S. in Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics (2015) from Lanzhou University. In 2019, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the supervision of Prof. [Jinglai Li](https://lijinglai.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiaoqun Zhang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/index.html). I then worked as an Algorithm Engineer at Meituan (2019-2020) before joining Central South University in July 2020.
