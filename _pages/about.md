Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a Lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central South University. I studied Mathematics and received a Bachelor's degree in 2012, along with a Master's degree in Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics from Lanzhou University in 2015. In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of [Jinglai Li](https://lijinglai.github.io/) and [Xiaoqun Zhang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/index.html). Subsequently, from 2019 to 2020, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at Meituan. In July 2020, I joined Central South University.


My research is mainly about new computing methods to solve challenging inverse problems, especially nonlinear inverse problems. We combine ideas from numerical analysis, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning to develop more accurate and efficient recovering algorithms. We are particularly interested in
1. Bayesian scientific computing
   - physics-guided deep generative models (GAN, VAE, diffusion model) to improve accuracy, efficiency, etc.
   - goal-oriented uncertainty quantification (UQ) through the combination of both forward UQ and reverse UQ

2. scientific machine learning
   - the emerging use of data-driven and machine learning methods to address problem classes that were out of reach for traditional methods
