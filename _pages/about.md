Welcome to my homepage! <br>
I am a Lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Statistics of Central South University. I studied Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and received a B.S. in 2012, followed by an M.S. in Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics in 2015, both from Lanzhou University. In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jinglai Li](https://lijinglai.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiaoqun Zhang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/index.html). Subsequently, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at Meituan from 2019 to 2020. In July 2020, I joined Central South University.
