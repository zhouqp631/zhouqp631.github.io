Welcome to my homepage! <br>
**Research:** I am interested in developing new computational methods for uncertainty quantification and scientific computing, integrating insights from numerical analysis, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning. My research mainly focuses on two areas: (1) uncertainty quantification for machine learning with physics models, which involves using physics-guided deep generative models (GAN, VAE, diffusion models) to improve model efficiency, interpretability, and trustworthiness; and (2) AI4Science in bioinformatics and beyond, which aims to transform scientific modelling and discovery through large-scale deep learning.
 
**Previously:** I studied Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and received a B.S. in 2012, followed by an M.S. in Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics from Lanzhou University in 2015. In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jinglai Li](https://lijinglai.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiaoqun Zhang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/index.html). Subsequently, from 2019 to 2020, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at Meituan. In July 2020, I joined Central South University.
