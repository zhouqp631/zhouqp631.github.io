Welcome to my homepage! <br>  <br>
**Research:** My research is concerned with finding new computational methods for solving challenging inverse problems by integrating ideas from numerical analysis, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning. My main focus is on (1) Bayesian scientific computing: physics-guided deep generative models (GAN, VAE, diffusion) to improve accuracy, efficiency, etc.; goal-oriented uncertainty quantification (UQ) through the combination of both forward UQ and reverse UQ; and (2) Scientific machine learning: the emerging use of data-driven and machine learning methods to address problem classes that were out of reach for traditional methods.
 
**Previously:** I studied Mathematics and received a Bachelor's degree in 2012 and a Master's degree in Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics from Lanzhou University in 2015. In 2019, I obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jinglai Li](https://lijinglai.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiaoqun Zhang](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xqzhang/index.html). Subsequently, from 2019 to 2020, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at Meituan. In July 2020, I joined Central South University.
